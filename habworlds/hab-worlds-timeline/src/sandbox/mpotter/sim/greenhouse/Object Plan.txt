Need:
    Y-axis graph autoscaling
    New graph object needs to:
        - Detect given value for highest point on graph
        - Scale down other points based on this point to keep all points
            within graph area
        - Hand off highest point to some formula that determines the new top Y-Axis value

Looking at mock ups suggests I will need the following:

    [done] Tabber.js
        - Holds child objects
        - Can set which child is currently active
        - Dynamically creates buttons based on children
        - Clicking a button sets the respective child to active
        - Inactive children are hidden, active children are visible

    Property Folder
        [done] Unit.js
            - Holds a core unit
            - Takes a unit exchange-rate object at start
            - Can be told to update what unit is being shown
            - Does all math with the core unit

        [done] InputSlider.js
            - Extends unit.js
            - Creates a header label
            - Creates a slider and text input
            - Adjusting one adjusts the other

        [done] PropertyLabel.js
            - Extends unit.js
            - A label with a static and dynamic portion
            - The dynamic portion can be set with a function call

    [done] NamedGroup.js
        - Creates a div
        - This is the thing that has the top, left, and right borders with the name in the middle of the top border

    Control folder
        [done] Base.js
            - Base object for control objects
            - Will contain abstracted functionality that is found to be shared amongst control objects

        [done] Star.js
            -creates a namedGroup
                - Creates an InputSlider
                - Creates three PropertyLabels
                - When the input slider is changed, update PropertyLabels

        [done] Planet.js
            - Creates two InputSliders

        [done] Atmosphere.js
            - Creates a NameGroup with three property labels
            - Creates a series of buttons
            - Creates a fixed-height div
            - As buttons are toggled on, the respective gas appears in the fixed-height div
            - Creates the following object when a button is toggled on:
                - GasAdjuster.js
                    - Is given the responsibility of creating a slider and contacting the parent when changes are made
            - Atmosphere.js has a listener that children call when changes are made

    Molecule folder
        View.js
            - Creates the dom elements and houses functions for creating dom elements

        Collider.js
            - Extends View.js
            - Manages particle-photon collisions

        Base.js
            - Hold hitbox info
            - Gets/Receives reference to Collider.js
            - Generic function for making visual dom elements based on config
            - Holds an empty animation function

        Photon.js
            - Extends Base.js
            - Creates look for photons
            - Manages photon animations for a single photon
            - Overrides animation function for sin-wave behavior

        Molecule.js
            - Extends Base.js
            - Creates look for gas molecules
            - Manages animations for a single gas
            - Ovverides animation function for bouncing behavior

    App folder
        [done] Base.js
            - Creates all the objects in the sim

        Manager.js
            - Manages interactions between objects
            - Plugs data into the Formula.js object
            - Holds the core game loop that everything else runs off of
            - Creates a dropdown
                - Changing this dropdown updates all PropertyLabels and SliderInputs to display the new unit

    Formula.js
        - Holds functions for getting appropriate data based on input for various things

    Graph objects:
        - Take graphs from atmospheric chamber
        - They may need adjustments

    [done] Space Folder
        View.js
            - Sets up dom objects and scene containing sun and earth

        Dynamic.js
            - Extends View.js
            - Updates the look of the scene based on information from the app
            - It will be the app's responsibility to contact the Dynamic.js
